# Exercise 1 – Implementing the Singleton Pattern

##  Objective:
Ensure that the Logger utility class is a singleton — only one instance should exist during the entire lifecycle of the application.

## Classes Implemented:
   -`Logger.java` – Implements the Singleton Pattern using:
  - Private constructor
  - Static private instance variable
  - Public static `getInstance()` method
  - `Main.java` – Verifies that only one `Logger` instance is used and            performs logging

## Output:
Logger Initialized
Log: First message
Log: Second message
Same Logger instance!
