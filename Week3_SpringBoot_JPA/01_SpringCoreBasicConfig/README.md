# Exercise1- Library Management – Spring Core (XML Configuration) &            Exercise5-   Configuring Spring IoC Container

  

This project demonstrates a simple Spring Core application using **XML-based configuration**with setter-based dependency injection.

Beans were defined in `applicationContext.xml`, and `BookService` received `BookRepository` through a setter method.  It's created as part of the **Cognizant Digital Nurture 4.0 – Java FSE Deep Skilling Program (Week 3)**.
